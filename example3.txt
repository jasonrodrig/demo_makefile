whatt is Round Robin Scheduling in C
Round Robin (RR) scheduling is one of the most widely used CPU scheduling algorithms developed to allocate CPU time to each process in a round-robin way. Round Robin scheduling is cyclic in nature and is also known as Time Slicing Scheduling. Each process is allotted a fixed time slice or quantum. If the process does not finish the execution of its work within the time assigned, it is placed at the end of the ready queue, and the CPU scheduler will pick up the next process. In this way, every process is treated more or less fairly; all processes will be given equal amounts of CPU time in a round-robin manner.
