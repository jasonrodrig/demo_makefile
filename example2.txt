Introduction

Imagine you're waiting for your turn on a carnival ride. Everyone in line gets a fixed amount of time on the ride. When your turn ends, you go back to the end of the line if you want to try again.

That’s exactly how Round Robin Scheduling works in operating systems.

If you are a CS student, preparing for OS / DSA interviews, or learning CPU scheduling, the Round Robin program in C is one of the most frequently asked concepts, both theoretically and in coding assignments. Understanding it helps you:

Crack OS viva/coding questions
Implement scheduling logic in C
Understand how real operating systems share CPU time fairly
In the next few minutes, you’ll learn:

What Round Robin Scheduling is
How it compares to FCFS
Working and step-by-step execution with diagrams
Example C programs (Zero Arrival Time, Sequential Arrival Time, Different Arrival Time)
Applications, advantages, and key points.
By the end, you will be able to write and explain the Round Robin program in C confidently, perfect for exams, projects, and interviews.
