Round Robin is a preemptive CPU scheduling algorithm where every process gets an equal and fixed CPU time slice (time quantum).

It prevents any single process from hogging the CPU, making it ideal for multitasking and time-sharing systems.

This blog walks you through: how Round Robin works, C programs with zero arrival time and different arrival times, real-life applications, and FAQs.
